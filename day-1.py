# datatypes, 4 for now: int, str, bool, float.
# int is for stuff like 1, 69, 420
# str is for stuff like 'Bernard', 's*x', "Weed"(this is not a mistake)
# bool is true or false
# float is for stuff like 420.69 (decimal numbers)

# ________________________
# variable.

print(name)
# Don't use "" for str. For some reason they just don't work, even though they are a string
